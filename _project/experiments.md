Experiments on game logic is good way for wasting my time.

Collection of different game logic in one place, these are not game just an experiment.

  -  Year : 2016
  -  Technology : Java language using libgdx 1.9.5, box-2d (physics engine)
  -  Obfuscator : obfuscation only of my own classes and packages using ProGuard
  -  Development time: after work !
  -  Links : [Itch.io](https://itsabhiaryan.itch.io/experiments), [Android](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47883257/Games/Experiments/Experiments.apk), [Desktop](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47883257/Games/Experiments/Experiments.jar)

Logic List

 1. Brain Dots : Draw or create physics body of any shape is main focus of game play.
 2. Ball Bucket : Three physics body and a trajectory path by small circle.
 3. Knock Down : Knock down the boxes using balls. Eight simple levels.
 4.   

  >  Donâ€™t have time so that I can convert these experiment into games.
