How to Play

  -  Drag a card onto any card of opposite suite and 1 greater value. Aces low.
  -  Click on a face-down card to flip it into play
  -  Drag (or double-click) Aces to the “Suite Stacks” at the top
  -  Click the deck (top-left) to cycle through its cards.
  -  Drag Kings onto empty card stacks.
  -  The object of the game is to get all the cards into the Suite Stacks at the top. Once the an Ace is in its Suite Stack, you can place additional cards of the same suite in that Suite Stack. The card must always be one greater than the current top card of the Suite Stack (2 goes on Ace, 5 goes on 3, king goes on queen, etc.)
